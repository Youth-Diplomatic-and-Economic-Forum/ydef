The Youth Diplomatic and Economic
Forum (YDEF) is a dynamic platform that
brings together young leaders, diplomats,
and experts from around the world. Their
mission is to foster dialogue, exchange
ideas, and address pressing global issues
related to diplomacy, international
relations, and economic development.
YDEF aims to empower the next
generation of change-makers by
providing them with practical knowledge,
networking opportunities, and exposure to
influential voices in the field.

**Our Aim**

1. To pioneer a platform where high school, college students and
academicians across India engage in meaningful diplomatic
dialogues with renowned figures in international politics,
fostering a deeper understanding of global issues and smart
diplomacy.

2. Facilitate discussions on India's economic landscape, focusing
on reforms, job creation, the creator economy, and emerging
technologies like lithium-ion batteries and cryptocurrency,
aiming to inform and inspire youth about economic prospects.

3. To broadcast these insightful conversations worldwide,
promoting global awareness of India's perspectives on
international politics, economic policies, and regional
responsibilities, thereby enhancing India's diplomatic outreach
and global influence.
